We add this information, along with project, article, granularity, timestamp, and agent information, to the combined dictionary (comb_dict) that we established in the function. The function ultimately returns the combined dictionary. Should the two input dictionaries have different keys or different timestamps/key, the function will print a message to the user asking them to input files with matching keys and/or matching timestamps/key."
